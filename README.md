# FlashcardsKitJS
A JavaScript toolkit for easily setting up new sets of flashcards

## Usage

Just copy the three files `index.html`, `demo.js`, and `demo-data.json`. Modify the latter two. 
And if you want to rename the `.js` and `.json` files, please make sure to reflect these changes by modifying the `<script></script>` tags in `index.html`.
